Producer Consumer Problem

Assume that the queue is empty but the consumer process is not releasing the
lock so no other consumer can access the lock. This will create a deadlock and
no producer or consumer will be able to acquire the lock. Producer won’t be
able to create an item and consumer won’t be able to consume. Due to deadlock,
waiting queue will increase and there will be memory management problem and hence
the system will crash.

This can be fixed by including a lock release statement inside the if block
when the queue is empty. That ways, the lock will be released and other
consumers and producers will be able to access the lock.

Producer
while (true) {
       item = generate_item()
       mutex.lock()
       fifo_queue.push(item)
       mutex.unlock()
       condition.signal()
}

Consumers
while(true) {
       mutex.lock()
       if (fifo_queue.empty()) {
            mutex.unlock()          # Fix
            condition.wait(mutex)
       }
       item = fifo_queue.remove()
       mutex.unlock()
       process_item(item)
}
